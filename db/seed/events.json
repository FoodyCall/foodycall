Heat the oil in a wok over a high heat until smoking. Add the green curry paste and stir fry for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant.\n\n      2. Add the chicken strips and stir until coated in the curry paste. Continue to stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the chicken has browned on all sides.\n\n      3. Add the coconut milk, lime leaves, fish sauce and sugar and stir well. Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Continue to simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.\n\n      4. Add the green beans and asparagus and continue to simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring regularly, until just tender. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n      5. To serve, spoon the rice into four serving bowls, then ladle over the Thai green chicken curry. Sprinkle over the coriander leaves.\n",

Beat the eggs, fish sauce, oyster sauce and white pepper until well combined. Add ground pork and beat until there are no more big clumps of pork. Stir in green onions.\n\n      2. Heat a small 8-inch non-stick saute pan or a wok over medium heat and add enough vegetable oil to generously coat the bottom. Wait for the oil to be quite hot, you can test by dropping a little bit of egg into the oil and it should puff and sizzle immediately.\n\n      3. Pour in the eggs all at once (it should sizzle), then quickly stir the egg for a few seconds to distribute the first bit of cooked egg.\n\n      4. As the bottom starts to firm up, lift one side of the omelette and tilt the pan to allow the liquid egg on top to flow to the bottom; repeat a couple of times.\n\n      5. Let the omelette cook until the bottom is golden brown and the top is set enough to flip. Keep checking the colour, if the omelette is browning too fast, turn the heat down a bit.\n\n      6. Once the top is set enough to flip, flip the omelette and continue cooking the other side just for 15-20 seconds just to cook it through.\n\n      7. Serve with hot jasmine rice and sriracha hot sauce!\n      ",

After washing the green papaya, peel off the skin using a carrot peeler (or a knife will do as well). You can then either use a cheese grater to shave the papaya, or you can do it the traditional way and hack at the papaya with your knife until there are numerous vertical cuts, then shave off the top layer into thin slivers, and repeat. I like the traditional method as you get bigger, un-even, pieces of green papaya. Cut enough green papaya to have a big handful worth for this recipe.\n\n      2. Add 2 cloves of peeled garlic and 5 chillies (or however many you like) to the mortar (krok). Pound them for a few seconds until the garlic is crushed and chilies are reduced to small bits.\n\n      3. Add ½ tablespoon of palm sugar, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and then squeeze the juice from 1 - 2 limes into the mortar. You can always start with less seasoning and add more to your liking.\n\n      4.Mix and pound the dressing, making sure the palm sugar gets fully dissolved into the liquid (so no one bites into a chunk of pure palm sugar).\n\n      5. Add about 1 tablespoon of roasted peanuts (no need to measure, just grab some with your hand), 1 tablespoon of dried shrimp, and then roughly slice in the tomatoes into the mortar\n\n      6. Pound the mixture for about 30 seconds, lightly breaking up the tomatoes, shrimp, and peanuts. No need to pound too hard.\n\n      7. Last step is to toss in a big handful of the green papaya shavings. Mix it all together, doing a combination of using just a spoon and pounding lightly, but no need to pound hard. Make sure the dressing is coating all the green papaya and that the salad is evenly mixed through and through\n\n      ",

        "recipe": "\n      - water to soak rice\n      - 1 kg. sticky rice\n\n      Instructions\n      1. The night before you want to cook sticky rice, take your raw sticky rice, place it into a bowl or plastic tub, submerge in water, and allow to soak room temperature overnight. Alternatively, you can soak for at least 4 - 5 hours, but overnight is best.\n\n      2. Take the sticky rice out of the water (and the grains should be softer and a little swollen), and place into a bamboo steamer, or any type of steamer. Cover the steamer with either a lid, or you can do what I did and cover the basket with a cloth, then a metal lid - just to keep all the steam within the rice.\n\n      3. Add water to a pot with the steamer over the pot (just make sure the water doesn’t touch the sticky rice), and once the water comes to a boil, steam for 15 - 20 minutes (usually 15 minutes for me is perfect) on a medium heat.\n\n      4. After 15 minutes take off the lid carefully, because it will be very hot, and just grab a taste test of the sticky rice to make sure it’s soft and fluffy. If it’s still a little crunchy, steam for a few more minutes, but if it’s good to go, turn off the heat and either eat immediately, or transfer to some sort of airtight container or basket to hold until you’re ready to eat.\n\n      5. Enjoy Thai sticky rice while it's hot and fresh.\n      ",

Drizzle over remaining marinade in the ziplock bag over the flesh side. Flip and cook the flesh side for 2 minutes, or to your liking.
